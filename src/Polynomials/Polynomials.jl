    (polynomial::AbstractPolynomials)(xi::Vector{Float64}, args...)::Array{Float64}

Call the `evaluate`-method for the given `polynomial`.

Wrapper for all `evaluate`-methods so that all `AbstractPolynomials` can 
be called by calling the struct instead of explicitly calling the 
`evaluate`-method. Automatically throws a MethodError if the subtype 
does not have an evaluate function implemented. Some of these methods 
may have additional arguments, such as the additional derivatives to 
evaluate, so this version should allow that as well.
