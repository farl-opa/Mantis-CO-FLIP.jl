"""
    clenshaw_curtis(p::Integer)

Find the roots and weights for Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature on the interval [0, 1]. The roots
include the endpoints 0 and 1 and Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature is exact for polynomials up to
degree `p`. However, in practise, this quadrature rule can obtain results comparable to
Gauss quadrature (in some cases), see [Trefethen2008](@cite) and [Trefethen2022](@cite).

# Arguments
- `p::Integer`: Degree of the quadrature rule.

# Returns
- `::CanonicalQuadratureRule{1}`: 1 dimensional quadrature rule containing the nodes and weights.
    There will be `p+1` nodes and weights.

# Notes
See [Waldvogel2006](@cite) for the algorithm based on fast fourier transforms. The algorithm
used here is a direct translation from the given MATLAB code on page 201.
