# MANTIS.jl Documentation

## Introduction
Welcome to the documentation for `MANTIS.jl`, a package for high-order 
structure-preserving finite element methods. This package is designed 
around structure-preserving/mimetic methods. It has extensive support for
basis functions; 'standard' mimetic finite elements, multi-patch splines, and
hierarchical splines. It is free and open source 
([MIT license](https://github.com/MantisFEM/Mantis.jl/blob/main/LICENSE)).
