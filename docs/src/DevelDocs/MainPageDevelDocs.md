# Developer Documentation
This part of the documentation is intended for those who want to 
contribute to the development of `Mantis.jl`. It includes documentation 
on parts of the code that are not designed for public access.

!!! danger "Developer Area"
    You are now in the developer documentations. This also contain 
    documents on parts of the code that are not designed for public access, 
    and that may change without warning. For the public documentation, see the
    [MANTIS.jl Documentation](@ref)

!!! note "Suggestion"
    I would suggest that the developer documentation has the same 
    structure as the source code, while the user docs can have a 
    different structure.

## All functions and stuff from Mantis.Geometry
```@autodocs
Modules = [Mantis.Geometry]
```
